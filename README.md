# Pascal_Mini_Compiler_with_C
This project is a simplified compiler for a subset of the Pascal programming language, written in C. It performs lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic checks, and generates intermediate code.

# Features

- Lexical Analysis: Identifies tokens such as keywords, operators, and identifiers.
- Syntax Parsing: Processes basic Pascal constructs (e.g., variable declarations, loops, and conditionals).
- Semantic Checking: Validates types and declarations.
-Intermediate Code Generation: Produces intermediate representations for supported grammar rules.

# Limitations
- Not all grammar rules of Pascal were implemented due to time constraints.
- The interpreter for executing the generated code was not developed.
